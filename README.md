# Flight Survey Insights
This project takes a look at an airline's survey results.  Within it, demographics, the impact of delays on reviews, favorability among demographics, and other factors are analyzed. 

## Description ##
An analysis performed on an airline's flight survey results has revealed trends among the airline's demographics. For example, with this analysis, we've
been able to discover that younger people are generally displeased with the airline compared to older generations.

Another discovery from the result's analysis is the fact that the most satisfied age group seems to be among 40-60 year olds, with a marked spike in disatisfaction in the 60-80 years old gorup:

Passengers also seemed to be less satisified on shorter flights than longer ones:
